I'm a developer advocate for [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net), living in
Cambridge [Massachusetts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvUMV1N7eGM).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kauffecup),
[GitHub](https://github.com/kauffecup/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-kaufman/a8/a21/77b),
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/jkauffe), and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kauffecup). And of course, I have two email
addresses: [gmail](mailto:jdkaufman5@gmail.com) and
[IBM](mailto:jdkaufma@us.ibm.com).

I joined IBM in 2013 and spent two years working on Verse. There are some cool
things about it [here](http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/newway/) - and
here's a pretty fun [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUO4tmCu2w0).
