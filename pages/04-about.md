I love writing beautiful code with smart, inspired teams that are as willing to
go the extra mile as I am. I also like to get creative - whether it be through
a visual output like film editing or anything music related (I've certainly made
some YouTube videos that I'm too embarrassed to embed right now, but trust me,
they're great). You can also find me singing
[here on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/5cDHaVTQ8coHB5NLssfp9S) from
back in my glory days in an all male college a cappella group.

Based in Cambridge, MA. Made in NJ.

## Experience

### IBM

#### Software Engineer (August 2016 - present)

Worked alongside a team of four to create the server-side technology for IBM's
[partnership with Harman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5fOVNSQrS0) in
creating a physical conversational agent for different conversation and
automation scenarios. Constructed the conversational model, developed a means
for device interaction using voice, designed the database for storing user
metadata, and built an admin UI for testing, debugging, and device management.

  - Collaborated with research teams across the world in building a
    conversational model that handles context and multiple expertises.
  - Designed a server-side websocket API for streaming audio to and from the
    Harman devices.
  - Built an end-to-end abstract solution that can be repurposed over different
    conversation models that allows multiple devices to connect to the server
    and communicate to different IoT controllers.
  - Worked with Watson Conversation Service, IBM Internet of Things Platform,
    Alchemy Natural Language Processing APIs, OpenWhisk (serverless technology),
    Cloudant, Speech to Text, and Text to Speech.

#### Developer Advocate (July 2015 - August 2016)

Responsible for working with developers to enable rapid application development
on top of IBM’s PaaS Bluemix, and by using IBM Watson Machine Learning and
Natural Language Processing APIs. By engaging with the developer community, I
was able to meet and exceed their expectations as a source of knowledge, help,
and ideas, enabling them to reach their own success using IBM's tools.

  - Led 8 technical sessions, and attended 20 developer conferences and meetups
    in 6 countries. By my last talk, the room was standing room only. Was able
    to cover a broad variety of topics - from application level logic, to
    deploying apps, to creating insights and visualizations using Watson
    services, to building slack bots entirely out of Openwhisk.
  - Wrote a series of blog posts detailing what I had learned about development
    and Bluemix throughout my work. In my posts I was able to get a little more
    technical and code heavy than in talks, which allowed me to engage the
    developer community on a different level, while still meeting and exceeding
    their expectations as a source of knowledge, help, and ideas, enabling them
    to reach their own success using IBM's tools.
  - Built and open sourced 6 demo applications showcasing different aspects of
    the platform and APIs; from building visualizations to IoT to
    microservice-based systems. These demos showcased the innovation that can be
    built using a combination of different services in the Bluemix Catalog. For
    example, the Election Insights app that I built using Alchemy Language to
    visualize sentiment and entities in the news queried around the election
    ended up accurately predicting both the primaries and general election. By
    open sourcing all of these demos, I enabled developers to get a complete
    view on how to use these services as well as the platform as a whole to
    create their own innovation.
  - Worked extensively with Cloud Foundry to design and create cloud native
    applications, along with Docker, React, React Native, Node.js, MongoDB,
    CouchDB, D3, and Java.

#### Software Engineer (June 2013 - July 2015)

Front-end web developer for IBM Verse, specifically on search, threads,
analytics, folders, and the overall framework.

  - Advocated for clean and modular code throughout the project’s entire
    codebase.
  - Iterated and collaborated on many UX and design decisions.
  - Conducted interviews for full time and intern candidates.
  - Worked with Apache SOLR, the Dojo Toolkit, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Java,
    and Jenkins.
