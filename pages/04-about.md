I love writing beautiful code with smart, inspired teams that are as willing to
go the extra mile as I am. I also like to get creative - whether it be through
a visual output like film editing or anything music related (I've certainly made
some YouTube videos that I'm too embarrassed to embed right now, but trust me,
they're great). You can also find me singing
[here on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/5cDHaVTQ8coHB5NLssfp9S) from
back in my glory days in an all male college a cappella group.

Based in Cambridge, MA. Made in NJ.

## Experience

### IBM

Working at IBM has proven to be invaluable for both learning opportunities and
from a career standpoint. Not only have I worked with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3,
Java, Python, React, Redux, Node, Dojo, Jasmine, Mocha, Docker, Kubernetes,
Cloud Foundry, Jenkins, Cloudant, CouchDB, MongoDB, Apache SOLR, and all of the
Watson machine learning and natural language processing services, but I was able
to rise to leadership positions and travel the world going to dozens of
conferences.

Throughout each of the teams I've been on, I have demonstrated an ability to
quickly get up to speed and become both a key contributor and leader on the
given project.

#### Software Engineer (August 2016 - present)

Worked alongside a team of four to create the server-side technology for IBM's
[partnership with Harman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5fOVNSQrS0) in
creating a physical conversational agent for different conversation and
automation scenarios. Constructed the conversational model, developed a means
for device interaction using voice, designed the database for storing user
metadata, and built an admin UI for testing, debugging, and device management.
Quickly rose from being the newest member on the team to the top contributor.

  - Collaborated with research teams across the world in building a
    conversational model that handles context and multiple expertises.
  - Designed a server-side websocket API for streaming audio to and from the
    Harman devices.
  - Built an end-to-end abstract solution that can be repurposed over different
    conversation models that allows multiple devices to connect to the server
    and communicate to different IoT controllers.
  - Worked with Watson Conversation Service, IBM Internet of Things Platform,
    Alchemy Natural Language Processing APIs, OpenWhisk (serverless technology),
    Cloudant, Speech to Text, and Text to Speech.

#### Developer Advocate (July 2015 - August 2016)

Responsible for working with developers to enable rapid application development
on top of IBM’s PaaS Bluemix, and by using IBM Watson Machine Learning and
Natural Language Processing APIs. By engaging with the developer community, met
and exceed their expectations as a source of knowledge, help, and ideas,
enabling them to reach their own success using IBM's tools.

  - Led 8 technical sessions, and attended 20 developer conferences and meetups
    in 6 countries. By the last talk, the room was standing room only. Was able
    to cover a broad variety of topics - from application level logic, to
    deploying apps, to creating insights and visualizations using Watson
    services, to building slack bots entirely out of Openwhisk.
  - Wrote a series of blog posts detailing development and Bluemix knowledge
    gained throughout my work. These posts were more technical and code heavy
    than in talks, which allowed engaging the developer community on a different
    level, while still meeting and exceeding their expectations as a source of
    knowledge, help, and ideas, enabling them to reach their own success using
    IBM's tools.
  - Built and open sourced 6 demo applications showcasing different aspects of
    the platform and APIs; from building visualizations to IoT to
    microservice-based systems. These demos showcased the innovation that can be
    built using a combination of different services in the Bluemix Catalog. For
    example, the Election Insights app, built using Alchemy Language to
    visualize sentiment and entities in the news queried around the election,
    ended up accurately predicting both the primaries and general election. By
    open sourcing all of these demos, developers gained introspection into the
    complete view on how to use these services as well as the platform as a
    whole to create their own innovation.
  - Worked extensively with Cloud Foundry to design and create cloud native
    applications, along with Docker, React, React Native, Node.js, MongoDB,
    CouchDB, D3, and Java.

#### Software Engineer (June 2013 - July 2015)

Front-end web developer for IBM Verse, specifically on search, threads,
analytics, folders, and the overall framework. Quickly rose to leadership
positions and was involved in many design, architecture, and infrastructure
decisions, while advocating for clean and modular code throughout the project’s
entire codebase.

  - Iterated and collaborated on many UX and design decisions with our design
    team.
  - Conducted interviews for full time and intern candidates.
  - Worked with Apache SOLR, the Dojo Toolkit, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Java,
    and Jenkins.

### Cornell University

#### Embedded Software Engineer (June 2011 - December 2012)

[FabatHome](http://www.fabathome.org/)

  - Wrote embedded code to re-implement established APIs on the new MSP430 based
    printer motherboard, allowing three motors to coordinate and create 3D
    paths.
  - Wrote host software for QT based developer GUI designed to aid debugging the
    system.
  - Established default system calibration values for new printers.

#### Teaching Assistant (August 2011 - May 2012)

Introduction to Circuits for Electrical and Computer Engineers

  - Guided students through a set of intermediate through advanced level
    problems.
  - Course material covered basic RLC circuits to filters and Laplacian
    Analysis.

    orchestra, as well as self-taught on guitar and piano.
  - Sang in the Cornell University Glee Club, and was musical director and
    president of the official a cappella subset.
