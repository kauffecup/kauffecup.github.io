  The more we interact with “smart apps,” the more we hear the word “cognitive”
  being thrown around. But what actually does this imply? What is a cognitive
  application? Can I make my app smarter? Can I make my app cognitive? In this
  session we'll be covering what these buzzwords mean and how to enhance your
  application with Watson services. We'll build an application from scratch and
  we'll discuss how to integrate Watson into your existing application.
