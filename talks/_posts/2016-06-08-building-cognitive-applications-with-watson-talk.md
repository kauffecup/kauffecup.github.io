  The more we interact with “smart apps,” the more we hear the word “cognitive”
  being thrown around. But what actually does this imply? What is a cognitive
  application? Can I make my app smarter? Can I make my app cognitive? In this
  session we'll be covering what these buzzwords mean and how to enhance your
  application with Watson services. We'll build an application from scratch and
  we'll discuss how to integrate Watson into your existing application.

  We will start with a demo of https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/election-insights
  which uses Alchemy for sentiment analysis and entity extraction along with
  visual recognition. That app is hosted here:
  http://electioninsights.mybluemix.net/#/. From there we will use Node-Red to
  quickly build an app that uses Watson Tone Analysis and translates tone into
  color.
