  Servers are killing your productivity. Rather than building better software
  for your users, you end up constantly distracted by maintaining computers.
  Wasn't the "cloud" supposed to fix this? It sounded so promising until we
  realized it was just renting VMs in someone else's datacenter. We couldn't
  escape "servers". Until now...

  In this session, developers will learn how to build microservices without
  servers, using modern “serverless” cloud platforms. We’ll look at common
  challenges (and solutions) to building applications using “serverless” stacks.
  Exploring emerging “serverless” design patterns will give developers the
  knowledge to build application architectures using these new platforms.

  This session is aimed at software developers experienced in building
  traditional backend web applications, who want to learn how to build
  microservices without servers.
