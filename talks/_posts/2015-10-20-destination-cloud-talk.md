abstract: >
  Our news feeds are full of stories talking about the failures and successes of
  companies that have moved applications to the cloud. Ultimately the consensus
  seems to be that moving applications to the cloud is a good thing, the next
  question is “how”? One solution that has taken the world by storm is Docker.
  While initially Docker seems promising, development and operations teams are
  often left with the problem of coming up with some type of Docker orchestration
  and management solution for deploying their applications. In this session we
  will get our hands dirty. We are going to use IBM Bluemix to get your
  application to the cloud and leverage the power and portability of Docker
  containers. We’ll talk about everything from build pipelines, to private
  registries, to container monitoring, and we’ll assess Bluemix as an end-to-end
  cloud solution for deploying Docker.
