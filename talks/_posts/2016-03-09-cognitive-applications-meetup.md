From the fluent website: "The Fluent Developer Community Lounge will feature
8 Meetups coordinated and sponsored by leading vendors in the Web Platform
space."

This won't be a traditional talk/session. Instead it will be a moderated
discussion that's more casual and informal about Cognitive Applications. No
slide deck, no demo, just a conversational, microphone engagement with a
sitting and standing audience.

Here's a [related blog post](/cognitive-applications) I wrote on the same topic.

There will also be a 5ish minute video/interview filmed after the meetup that
I'll post here (when available).
