  Microservices seem to be all that anyone is talking about these days; long
  gone is the monolithic app. The idea is simple - take one large app and break
  it into a bunch of tinier apps that interact in a reliable and fault-tolerant
  way. This brings with it a new set of functional and technical challenges to
  overcome - how do these "tiny apps" communicate? How do they discover each
  other? How big is too big? In this talk, we will build a microservice-based
  architecture up from scratch, while discussing different design patterns and
  common pitfalls, all in Node.js.
