I'm not gonna speak too much about this here as I already wrote a
[blog post about it](/react-web-native-codesharing/) (and also I've sort of
stopped maintaining it over the past few months - don't judge me too harshly).

The need to do this came up from an app I was building for work, and I ended up
building this example app to help explain myself during the resulting blog post.
While it ended up being a neat concept (and my most read post by far), I
recognize that very few applications will share enough logic between their web
and native apps for it to be applicable. Regardless, very fun!
