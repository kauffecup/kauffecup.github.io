I discuss this more on my [about](/about) page, but I worked alongside a team of
four to create the server-side technology for IBM's
[partnership with Harman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5fOVNSQrS0) in
creating a physical conversational agent for different conversation and
automation scenarios. We constructed the conversational model, developed a means
for device interaction using voice, designed the database for storing user
metadata, and built an admin UI for testing, debugging, and device management.
