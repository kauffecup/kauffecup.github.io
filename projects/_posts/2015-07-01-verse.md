I'd be remiss to not include my first project at IBM here. Verse is a single
page web application replacement of <s>Lotus</s> IBM Notes. It still uses the
same Domino backend as Notes, but creates its own SOLR index for speedy
searching. As I was there from when the team was only 5 people, I've had my
hands pretty much all over the app.
