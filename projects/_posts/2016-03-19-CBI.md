The best part of the Boston summer is <a href="http://www.community-boating.org/">Community Boating</a> (CBI, pictured above), a gem on the shores of the Charles, providing sail boats for everyone.  
<br>
I designed and built an art piece that sits in my kitchen, providing a constant mirror of the river's sailing conditions. CBI has an internal flag system, where flag color is related to the wind conditions (green - light wind, yellow - medium wind, red - get off your butt and go sailing!). 
<br><br>
The WindDial watches the CBI website, and colors its interface accordingly.
