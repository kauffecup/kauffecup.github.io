<h6>Sam in 10 seconds:</h6>

I am a builder, artist, engineer, adventurer, and amateur philosopher.
<br><br>
In the most literal sense of the word, I strive to create â€˜remarkable' products.
<br><br>
Born in California. Living in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<br><br>
I enjoy thinking/talking/building/experiencing education, adrenaline, sailing, technology, and backgammon.
