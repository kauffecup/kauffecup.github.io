I went for a hike with my brother in Memorial Park, a beautiful area nestled in California's coastal redwoods. We paused for a sip water, and proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes on our stomachs, as we stared eye to optic-tentacle with a banana slug.

Update: Here is a note I recieved from my father. Apparently I have a long standing fascination with these yellow creatures. 

>hi sam-
<br>when you were approx 2 1/2 we went hiking
in Woodside-Wunderilich in redwoods in the rainy season. On an uphill slope, 
ferns and fallen needles, we pointed out to you a glistening yellow banana slug.
you scrambled unsteadily over to it, paused, then raised your foot high and
squashed it.
