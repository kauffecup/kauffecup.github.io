  The best AV in town, comfy stadium seating, and popcorn. Need I say more?

This week I was at [code.talks](https://www.codetalks.de/) in Hamburg, and let
me tell you... it was awesome. I went with my colleagues [Niklas
Heidloff](https://twitter.com/nheidloff), [James
Thomas](https://twitter.com/thomasj), and [Tristan
Reckhaus](https://twitter.com/trecks), advocating [IBM
Bluemix](https://bluemix.net).

The main issues I've experienced in conferences always center around audiovisual
equipment. Who hasn't seen someone fumbling with a projector or a mic for the
first few seconds/minutes while beginning a talk?

Movie theaters have arguably the best audiovisual equipment around; I mean...
just check out how huge this screen is:

I've never had an easier time reading slides, or understanding projected code.

Not only that, but the seats were incredibly comfortable and everyone could see
everything.

Not only not only that, but the sheer darkness of each theater discouraged
people from distractedly using their phones and laptops.

Plus, the unlimited nachos and popcorn were pretty cool.

Cheers to great talks, great food, and a great venue.
